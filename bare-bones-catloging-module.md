# Creating a Bare Bones Cataloging Module

**Purpose** The purpose of this assignment is to expand our bare bones OPAC
by adding a cataloging functionality. This provides a new means of entering data.

**Tasks**

1. Create a new directory. 
'''
cd /var/www/html
'''

'''
sudo mkdir cataloging
''' 

2. Use Nano to create index.html file and add content.

'''
cd cataloging
sudo nano index.html
'''

3. Create a PHP script to facilitate the communication of
data from the cataloging module to the database. Add content from 
manual into Nano. 

4. Ensure the web form is secure by using Apache2
authorization mechanism.
